Bascially you can just run from top to bottom without any special indications.
I didn't delete some of the debugging lines like print(...), please ignore the lines I commented out.
Just to play it for safe that I may lose the data, I actually hardcoded all the best C value,
and stored them as a 1-element-only array. 
I also changed some of the code in featurize.py because I used that to find the 
most common words in spam and ham to see what features I should add. 
But I also commented them out since I only use it in terminal. 
Thank you so much for reading, and hope you have a nice day!
