Random seed = 100
Bascially you can just run from top to bottom without any special indications.
I didn't delete some of the debugging lines like print(...), please ignore the lines I commented out.
For 5.2, I have step size = 0.001, regularization parameter = 0.1
For 5.4, I have step size = 0.01, regularization parameter = 0.1
For 5.2, I have step size = 0.01, regularization parameter = 0.1, delta = 1
And for all the w, every starting element is randomly chose between 0 and 1. 
For Kaggle, I didn't add anything special so no worries. 
Thank you so much for reading, and hope you have a nice day!
